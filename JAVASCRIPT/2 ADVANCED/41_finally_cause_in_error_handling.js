// The finally clause
// The tryâ€¦ catch construct may have one more code clause: finally
/*
If it exists it runs in all cases:

 1. after try if there were no errors
 2. after catch if there were errors
 
If there is a return in try, finally is executed just before the control returns to the outer code.
