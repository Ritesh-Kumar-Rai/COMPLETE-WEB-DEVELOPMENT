// * Inheritance Method Overriding and super keyword in OOP

// Method Overriding
// If we create our own implementation of run, it will not be taken from the Animal class. This is called Method Overriding.

// super keyword
// When we override a method, we donâ€™t want the method of the previous class to go in vain. We can execute it using super keyword.
